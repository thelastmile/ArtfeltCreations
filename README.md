###Note from Erin
K,
First, thanks for the input the other day.

So far, we have the framework for our home page, about page, and our filter page.

We have a little of the functionality started and our upcoming tasks will be to work on more of that. This will include the filtering functions, addToCart functions, etc...

If you have any comments or suggestions, please let us know.

Thanks.
Team Art Felt Creations
