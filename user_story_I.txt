I am someone who loves art and I also love to help my community.
	So, I want to see something that is visually appealling but also allows me to feel good about what I spend my money on.

Mr. Joe Smith Jr., Age 63
As someone interested in purchasing art from unique sources I would love to have an additional source of  potentially valuable art. In the process I am able to help a worthy cause.

Mrs. R. Fleetworth Age 47
I am retired an interested in just looking at the artwork to see what is availible. I would like something different to hang up in my office and home.

I am interested in just looking at the art to see what is avialible for now. Later I may purchase some.
